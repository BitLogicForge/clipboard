    "\n",
    "- **1950s**: The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy. Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test.\n",
    "- **1960s-70s**: Early AI programs like ELIZA appeared. First \"expert systems\" were developed.\n",
    "- **1980s-90s**: Machine learning gained popularity. Chess computers began competing with humans.\n",
    "- **2000s-10s**: Big data and deep learning revolution. IBM's Watson won Jeopardy in 2011.\n",
    "- **2010s-Present**: Rapid advancements in neural networks, language models, and computer vision.\n"
