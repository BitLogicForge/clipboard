Interactive LLM Learning Examples
Based on your example that demonstrates next word prediction with visualizations, here are 6 more interactive notebooks to help someone learn about language models:

1. Text Sentiment Analysis
Create an interactive analyzer that takes user input and displays sentiment scores (positive/negative/neutral) with a confidence gauge. Learners will understand how models classify emotional tone.

2. Text Generation with Parameters
Build a notebook where users can enter a prompt and adjust generation parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.) to see how they affect text completion. Include visualizations of token probabilities.

3. Named Entity Recognition
Develop an interactive tool that highlights entities (people, places, organizations) in user text with different colors. Show confidence scores for each detected entity.

4. Question-Answering System
Create a two-panel interface where users can upload/paste a document in one panel and ask questions in another. Visualize how the model finds and extracts answers from the source text.

5. Text Summarization Explorer
Build a notebook that lets users paste longer text and generate summaries at different lengths/compression rates. Compare extraction vs. abstraction methods.

6. Semantic Search Visualization
Develop a demo where users can search through a document collection using natural language queries. Visualize document embeddings in 2D/3D space to show how semantic similarity works.

Each example should follow your interactive pattern with widgets for input, clear visualization of results, and explanatory components that help learners understand what's happening under the hood.
