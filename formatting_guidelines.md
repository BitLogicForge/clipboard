# AI Introduction Notebooks - Formatting Guidelines

## General Formatting

- Use consistent header sizes:
  - Title: H1 (#)
  - Main sections: H2 (##)
  - Subsections: H3 (###)
  - Minor points: H4 (####)

- Code cells:
  - Add comments for complex operations
  - Include output examples where helpful
  - Use consistent indentation (4 spaces recommended)

- Markdown cells:
  - Start each major section with a brief introduction
  - Use bullet points for lists
  - Use numbered lists for sequential steps
  - Include images with descriptive alt text

## File Naming Convention

For each topic, use the following format:
```
01_introduction_to_ai.ipynb
02_machine_learning_basics.ipynb
03_neural_networks.ipynb
...
```

## Visual Consistency

- Use consistent spacing between sections
- Add divider lines (---) between major sections
- Include a table of contents at the beginning
- End with references/resources section

## Example Structure

Each notebook should follow this general structure:

1. Title and Introduction
2. Prerequisites and Setup
3. Main Content (with consistent section numbering)
4. Practice Exercises
5. Summary
6. References
