# Interactive LLM Learning Examples

## Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Language Models

Before diving into advanced applications, these notebooks help understand the core principles:

1. **Tokenization Visualization** - `01_tokenization_visualization.ipynb`  
   Create an interactive tool showing how text is split into tokens. Users can input any text and see how different tokenizers break it down, with visual representation of token boundaries and frequencies.

2. **Word Embeddings Explorer** - `02_word_embeddings_explorer.ipynb`  
   Build a notebook demonstrating how words are represented as vectors. Visualize word similarities, analogies (king-man+woman=queen), and allow users to explore nearest neighbors in embedding space.

3. **Attention Mechanism Playground** - `03_attention_mechanism_playground.ipynb`  
   Develop a visualization showing how attention works in transformers. Allow users to input sentences and see attention weights between words represented as heat maps or connection lines.

4. **Fine-tuning Simulator** - `04_fine_tuning_simulator.ipynb`  
   Create a simplified simulation of how models adapt to specific tasks through fine-tuning. Show before/after performance on custom datasets with interactive controls.

## Chapter 2: Interactive Advanced Applications

Based on examples that demonstrate next word prediction with visualizations, here are interactive notebooks to help someone learn about language models:

1. **Text Sentiment Analysis** - `05_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`  
   Create an interactive analyzer that takes user input and displays sentiment scores (positive/negative/neutral) with a confidence gauge. Learners will understand how models classify emotional tone.

2. **Text Generation with Parameters** - `06_text_generation_parameters.ipynb`  
   Build a notebook where users can enter a prompt and adjust generation parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.) to see how they affect text completion. Include visualizations of token probabilities.

3. **Named Entity Recognition** - `07_named_entity_recognition.ipynb`  
   Develop an interactive tool that highlights entities (people, places, organizations) in user text with different colors. Show confidence scores for each detected entity.

4. **Question-Answering System** - `08_question_answering_system.ipynb`  
   Create a two-panel interface where users can upload/paste a document in one panel and ask questions in another. Visualize how the model finds and extracts answers from the source text.

5. **Text Summarization Explorer** - `09_text_summarization.ipynb`  
   Build a notebook that lets users paste longer text and generate summaries at different lengths/compression rates. Compare extraction vs. abstraction methods.

6. **Semantic Search Visualization** - `10_semantic_search.ipynb`  
   Develop a demo where users can search through a document collection using natural language queries. Visualize document embeddings in 2D/3D space to show how semantic similarity works.

## Chapter 3: Real-World Applications & Use Cases

1. **Creative Writing Assistant** - `11_creative_writing_assistant.ipynb`  
   Build an interactive tool that helps users draft stories with suggestions for plot development, character descriptions, and dialogue. Show how the model can continue a narrative in different styles.

2. **Code Generation & Explanation** - `12_code_generation_explanation.ipynb`  
   Create a notebook where users can describe a programming task in natural language and see generated code with line-by-line explanations. Include debugging assistance and alternative implementations.

3. **Language Translation with Cultural Context** - `13_language_translation_context.ipynb`  
   Develop a translation tool that not only converts text between languages but explains cultural nuances and idioms. Visualize how meaning shifts across languages.

4. **Virtual Interview Coach** - `14_virtual_interview_coach.ipynb`  
   Build a simulation where users can practice job interviews with an AI interviewer, receiving feedback on their responses and suggestions for improvement in real-time.

5. **Email/Message Tone Adjuster** - `15_message_tone_adjuster.ipynb`  
   Create a tool that helps users rewrite messages for different audiences (formal, casual, persuasive) with explanations of the stylistic changes and their likely impact.

## Chapter 4: Ethical Considerations & Limitations

1. **Bias Detective** - `16_bias_detective.ipynb`  
   Develop an interactive tool that helps users identify potential biases in language model outputs across different topics or demographic references.

2. **Hallucination Highlighter** - `17_hallucination_highlighter.ipynb`  
   Create a notebook demonstrating how language models can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, with techniques to detect and mitigate this behavior.

3. **Privacy Boundary Explorer** - `18_privacy_boundary_explorer.ipynb`  
   Build an interactive demonstration showing how models can be designed to refuse inappropriate requests while explaining the ethical boundaries being enforced.

## Chapter 5: Financial Applications & Investment Analysis

1. **Portfolio Performance Predictor** - `19_portfolio_performance_predictor.ipynb`  
   Build an interactive tool where users can input portfolio compositions (stocks, bonds, ETFs) and receive natural language analysis of historical performance, risk metrics, and future projections with confidence intervals visualized as gradient bands.

2. **Financial Document Analyzer** - `20_financial_document_analyzer.ipynb`  
   Create a notebook that processes financial statements, earnings reports, or prospectuses and extracts key metrics, trends, and risk factors. Visualize sentiment analysis of management discussions alongside quantitative data.

3. **Investment Strategy Simulator** - `21_investment_strategy_simulator.ipynb`  
   Develop an interactive model that helps users test different asset allocation strategies across market conditions. Visualize how portfolio composition affects risk-return profiles with interactive Efficient Frontier plots.

4. **ESG Impact Explorer** - `22_esg_impact_explorer.ipynb`  
   Build a tool that analyzes companies or funds for environmental, social, and governance factors using text from sustainability reports and news. Show how language models can quantify qualitative ESG descriptions.

5. **Market Sentiment Dashboard** - `23_market_sentiment_dashboard.ipynb`  
   Create a visualization connecting news headlines, social media sentiment, and price movements. Show how language models process financial news to predict market reactions across different asset classes.

6. **Personalized Financial Advisor** - `24_personalized_financial_advisor.ipynb`  
   Develop a conversational interface that helps users understand complex financial products by explaining them in simple terms tailored to the user's knowledge level, with interactive Q&A about specific investment vehicles.
